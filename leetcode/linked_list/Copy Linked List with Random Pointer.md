# Copy Linked List with Random Pointer

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list of length `n`. Unlike a singly linked list, each node contains an additional pointer `random`, which may point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Create a **deep copy** of the list.

The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` new nodes, each including:

- The original value `val` of the copied node
- A `next` pointer to the new node corresponding to the `next` pointer of the original node
- A `random` pointer to the new node corresponding to the `random` pointer of the original node

**Note:** None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

In the examples, the linked list is represented as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where `random_index` is the index of the node (0-indexed) that the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: head = [[3,null],[7,3],[4,0],[5,1]]
Output: [[3,null],[7,3],[4,0],[5,1]]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: head = [[1,null],[2,2],[3,2]]
Output: [[1,null],[2,2],[3,2]]
```

# UMPIRE Framework

A systematic approach to solving coding interview problems.

---

## 🎯 U - Understand

- Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem
- Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs
- Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs

## 🔍 M - Match

- See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

## 📝 P - Plan

- Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
- Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram

## 💻 I - Implement

- Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

## ✅ R - Review

- Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
- Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

## ⚡ E - Evaluate

- Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
- Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

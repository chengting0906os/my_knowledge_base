# Word Ladder

## Problem Description

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter
- Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`
- `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**

## UMPIRE

### U - Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

**Key Observations:**

### M - Match

> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

**Pattern:**

### P - Plan

> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram.

```python

```

### I - Implement

> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants).

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        pass
```

### R - Review

> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.

### E - Evaluate

> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.

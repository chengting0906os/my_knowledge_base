# Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"cat"` is a subsequence of `"crabt"`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

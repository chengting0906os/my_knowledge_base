# Unique Paths

## Problem Description

There is an `m x n` grid where you are allowed to move either **down** or **to the right** at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that can be taken from the top-left corner of the grid `(grid[0][0])` to the bottom-right corner `(grid[m - 1][n - 1])`.

You may assume the output will fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 6
Output: 21
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

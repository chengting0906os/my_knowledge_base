# Valid Anagram

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters

## UMPIRE

### U - Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

**Key Observations:**

### M - Match

> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

**Pattern:**

### P - Plan

> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram.

### I - Implement

> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants).

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        pass
```

### R - Review

> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.

### E - Evaluate

> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.

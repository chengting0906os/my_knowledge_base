# Valid Sudoku

## Problem Description

You are given a `9 x 9` Sudoku board `board`. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

- Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.
- Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.
- Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

Return `true` if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return `false`.

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","1",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are two `1`s in the top-left `3x3` sub-box.
```

## Constraints

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`

## UMPIRE

### U - Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

**Key Observations:**

### M - Match

> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

**Pattern:**

### P - Plan

> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram.

### I - Implement

> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants).

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        pass
```

### R - Review

> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.

### E - Evaluate

> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.

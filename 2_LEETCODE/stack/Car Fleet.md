# Car Fleet

## Problem Description

There are `n` cars traveling to the same destination on a one-lane highway.

You are given two integer arrays `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`.

- `position[i]` is the position of the `i`th car (in miles)
- `speed[i]` is the speed of the `i`th car (in miles per hour)

The destination is at position `target` miles.

A car cannot pass another car ahead of it. It can only catch up to another car and then drive at the same speed as the car ahead of it.

A **car fleet** is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. A single car is also considered a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet the moment the fleet reaches the destination, then the car is considered to be part of the fleet.

Return the number of different car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: target = 10, position = [1,4], speed = [3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The cars starting at 1 (speed 3) and 4 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 10, the destination.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: target = 10, position = [4,1,0,7], speed = [2,2,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The cars starting at 4 and 7 become a fleet at position 10. The cars starting at 1 and 0 never catch up to the car ahead of them. Thus, there are 3 car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
```

## Constraints

- `n == position.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 < target <= 1000`
- `0 < speed[i] <= 100`
- `0 <= position[i] < target`
- All the values of `position` are unique

## UMPIRE

### U - Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

**Key Observations:**

### M - Match

> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

**Pattern:**

### P - Plan

> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram.

### I - Implement

> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants).

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: list[int], speed: list[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

### R - Review

> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.

### E - Evaluate

> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.

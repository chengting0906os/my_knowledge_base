# Largest Rectangle In Histogram

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of a bar. The width of each bar is `1`.

Return the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed among the bars.

Note: This chart is known as a histogram.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: heights = [7,1,7,2,2,4]
Output: 8
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: heights = [1,3,7]
Output: 7
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= heights.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 1000`

## UMPIRE

### U - Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a "happy path" test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

**Key Observations:**

### M - Match

> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

**Pattern:**

### P - Plan

> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram.

### I - Implement

> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants).

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: list[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

### R - Review

> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.

### E - Evaluate

> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
